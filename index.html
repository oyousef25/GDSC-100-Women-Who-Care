            <h2>How 100 women who care began</h2><br>
            <p>Karen Dunigan initiated the first chapter of 100 Women Who Care in 2006. Living and working in the town
                of Jackson Michigan, her idea of bringing together caring individuals to address local immediate needs
                was a result of an offhand comment during a business lunch with the excecutive leadership group of a
                Family Health team. The discussion; how to fundraise for cribs, recognizing that some of the families
                could not afford to buy cribs and new mothers were bringing their babies home and placing the sleeping
                infants in boxes, dresser drawers, or their own beds. Some of these babies didn’t survive the night.<br><br>

                Karen decided to take action on a need. She knew that by herself, it was a big task but by inviting
                others to help out…well it really was a perfect plan….she knew there had to be a way to quickly and
                easily meet the financial request presented. With all of her involvement in the community, Karen knew
                she could call 10 people and ask them to write a check for $1000 but she also figured she knew 100 women
                who would each give $100. She began making phone calls and scheduled a meeting. At that first meeting in
                one hour a group of Karen’s friends heard the story of the Center for Family Health and everyone in the
                room wrote a cheque resulting in a total donation of $12,800. The amount was more than requested to
                supply new mothers with the simplest need-a crib for their babies. Karen recognized that she was onto
                something special. From there, 100 Women Who Care was born. She found the first 100+ women who care and
                scheduled a quarterly meetings. The rules were simple; any member could present a need in the community,
                there was an immediate need and the money had to remain local.<br><br>

                The idea was that the women could support a worthy cause that would benefit many in the community<br>

                Karen unfortunately passed away in 2014 but her legacy lives on through the expansion of 100+ chapters
                throughout the world. There are no more than 900 chapters either fully operational or under development.
                They include women, men, people, kids, and teen chapters. Karen saw people for their strengths and
                realized that 100 or more people coming together resulted in each person’s potential to be a powerful
                force to lift up the community.<br><br>

                Each one of us are strong but together we are a force to be reckoned with.</p>

            <h2>About Us</h2><br>
            <p>The Oxford County chapter of 100 women who care was started in 2015 by a local lawyer Kelly Edmonson. She
                with Lorraine Garnham and Karen Horeth introduced this simple and effective concept to Oxford County.

                They were able to grow membership and it continues to grow. Many thanks to the women who have donated
                since that our chapter began. Our local chapter is run by a volunteer steering committee each one who
                play a valuable part in keeping 100 Women Who Care going.

                Current committee members include Denise Tew, Nancy Komsa Sydnie Crockett and Giselle Lutfallah</p>
